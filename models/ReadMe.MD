"GraphQL API for generating personalized resumes. Allows creating customized resume JSON data by querying for work experience, education, skills, etc. Features a clean UI for composing and exporting resumes as PDFs.

The API provides full CRUD capabilities for managing resume data. Written in NodeJS using GraphQL Schema and Apollo Server. The frontend is built using React and Material UI for a responsive design.

Resumes can be dynamically filtered and visualized using charts/graphs to showcase skills and experience. Ideal for developers wanting to showcase their technical skills to recruiters through customized API queries.
